# Hotel Management System

## Setup
1. Make sure you have `MySQL` and a web server to run/interpret `PHP` in your system.
2. Clone or download the repo and put it to `MAMP/htdocs/` if you're using windows, otherwise check tutorial(s) for your corresponding web server and OS. 
3. Install dependencies for JavaScript, `npm install` and PHP, `composer install`.
4. Create a database named `hotel` and run the script `hotel.sql` to create tables. Make sure your configuration matches with `app/DB.php`, otherwise make the desired changes.
5. Run the app by `http://localhost/hotel-mgmt-system-master/index.php`.
